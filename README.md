# Todo List application in Flask(Python)

- Create an item in the todo list
- Read the complete todo list
- Update the items with status as "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Complete"
- Delete the items from the list

## REST?
REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for building web services and APIs. It requires the systems implementing REST to be stateless. The client sends a request to the server to retrieve or modify resources without knowing what state the server is in. The servers send the response to the client without needing to know what was the previous communication with the client.
Each request to the RESTful system commonly uses these 4 HTTP verbs:
- `GET`: Get a specific resource or a collection of resources
- `POST`: Create a new resource
- `PUT`: Update a specific resource
- `DELETE`: Remove a specific resource

## And. Flask?
Flask is a framework for Python to develop web applications. It is non-opinionated, meaning that it does not make decisions for you. Because of this, it does not restrict to structure your application in a particular way. It provides greater flexibility and control to developers using it. Flask provides you with the base tools to create a web app, and it can be easily extended to include most things that you would need to include in your app.
